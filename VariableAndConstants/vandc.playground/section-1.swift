    In this part we're practicing variable declaration and String concatenation.

    Swift has two reserved word for variable declaration: var and let.

/*
    Variables can be of any type. The type of a variable is described by the nature of the data that it holds.
    There are multiple type of data:
    
    * String
    * int
    * double 
    * float
    * more... 

    Swift is not a forced typed language. It means that the variable can be declared or created without specifying the type of variable that
    it will be containing. In this case the data itself defines the type of the variable. 

    Said so, a variable can be implicitly or explicitly declared. 

*/

// The type is explicitly declared.
var str = "Hello, playground"

// The type is implicitly declared.
var shape: String = "Triangle"

// let is a keyword reserved for constant variable declaration. It means the once the value is assigned, it can't be changed.

// The type is explicitly declared.
let str2 = "Hello, playground"

// The type implicitely declared.
let shape2: String = "Rectangle"
