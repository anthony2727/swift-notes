    Playground is a project that aim tho help learning the Swift programming language. 

    In this part we're practicing variable declaration and String concatenation.

/*
    Swift has two reserved word for variable declaration: var and let. (We'll explain the difference in the next section)

var name = "Anthony"
let lastname = "Rodriguez"
/*
    Variables can be of any type. The type of a variable is described by the nature of the data that it holds.
    There are multiple type of data:
    
    * String
    * int
    * double 
    * float
    * more... 

    Swift is not a typed language. It means that the variable can be declared or created without specifying the type of date that 
    it will be containing. In this case the data itself defines the type of the variable. 

    Said so, a variable can be implicitly or explicitly declared. 

*/

// The type is implicitly declared.
var str = "Hello, playground"

// The type is explicitly declared.
var shape: String = "Triangle"

// *The same using let*

// The type is implicitly declared.
var str2 = "Hello, playground"

// The type is explicitly declared.
var shape2: String = "Rectangle"


//End of section. Thanks.
